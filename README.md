# Goal
A sudoku application and sudoku solver to showcase code I have written.

# Progress
I started off with an application that forced single numbers in each cell.
My next step was to add a settings class to track a user's active settings.
While pursuing menu options, I made multiple updates to object types and my general approach for tracking all the cells.
After succesfully adding a few unimplemented options to the menu, I implemented an empty style for empty cells.
Adding duplicate checking proved quite difficult. After a lot of time, the new code I pushed was refactored, contained a logger, and I believe my hanlding of all objects is finalized.
